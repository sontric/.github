# Sontric
 
Side quests. Garage lab.
Bench snacks. Mostly harmless.

Tools & mischief. Projects for no good reason.
Unauthorized experiments. Probably a bad idea.

A folder of problems. It seemed reasonable.
Ship it (eventually). Bits, volts, vibes.

Small tools, big opinions. Notes from the lab.
Unreasonably effective. Engineering, but like… casually.
